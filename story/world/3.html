S"Ten days ago the prime minister shocked many MPs by declaring that - in future - the government might arm the Syrian rebels and comparing those who urged caution with those who did nothing as hundreds of thousands were slaughtered in the Bosnian conflict.\nSince then the concerns expressed not just by Labour but also by many Tory backbenchers and some within his own cabinet has persuaded David Cameron to moderate his tone and to promise a Commons vote on the issue.\nBefore that, though, it is now clear what the focus will be of both the G8 summit in Fermanagh next week and, in particular, of the prime minister's eve-of-summit meeting with Russia's President Putin."

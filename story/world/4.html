S'Click the video above to watch.The all night music and art festival, which traditionally happens on the last Thursday in June, is a commemoration of historic Tel Aviv\'s awarding of World Heritage Site status from UNESCO in 2003.\nAlthough the term "white night" usually refers to the days around the summer solstice at high latitudes (when the sun sets late and rises early, keeping the sky from ever fully becoming dark), Tel Aviv is far south enough that the sun rarely sets past 8 p.\nThe White Night Festival is nevertheless a celebration of the night -- municipal ordinances allow shops to stay open much later than normal -- and this promotional ad embraces that concept beautifully.'

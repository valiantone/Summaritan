S'Directors Raj & DK, in their fourth outing after Flavors, 99 and Shor in the City, try to give a niche film mainstream dumbness.The first thing you need to know about Go Goa Gone is that it rarely takes itself seriously and is not afraid to get downright silly.\nMake up your mind, guys!\nFrom successful and uncompromising middle of the road filmmaking, the directors this time try a crossover to the mainstream only to end up on the wall.'

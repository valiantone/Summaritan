S'My own regimen will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center.My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.\nOnce I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much I could.\nI want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.'

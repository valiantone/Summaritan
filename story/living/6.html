S'Welsh fans traditionally dress as daffodils, while a group of New Zealanders came in full Muppet regalia, as Kermit, Elmo, Animal, the Swedish Chef and Fozzie Bear.Every scrum, a grappling match for possession after certain stoppages, is a chance for a turnover, as is every line in, the return of the ball to play after it goes out of bounds.\nFifteens was last played as an Olympic sport in 1924, but was dropped for being too time consuming and ironically, the US, who might not even qualify for Rio, is the defending gold medalist.\nLike Formula 1 or soccer, devoted fans follow Sevens around the globe, and many come in elaborate costumes, most of which have little or nothing to do with either rugby or nationalism.'

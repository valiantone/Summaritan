S'The fact that their choice is the conservative PTI, is a reflection of how the PTI has promised to deal with drones, the Taliban, and other militant factors.This time round, in 2013, while the transition, the first ever from a democratically elected government to another, is very different compared to 1988, the importance of a break from the past, is perhaps more powerful than that of the 1988 elections.\nNot only was there just no leader, there was no Bhutto to lead the party, clearly one of the two factors which led to the party, again for the very first time, receiving the third, rather than the second, highest number of votes.\n3 The past history of the PPP and Nawaz Sharif throughout the 1990s was one of putting each other down, and looking to the military to oust the incumbent and replace it with the ever-ready opposition-in-waiting.'

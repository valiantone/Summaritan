S'But the real point that Manning threw up for debate through his actions is why the American administration did not regard the people of Iraq as human.In the thesis he turned in at the end of the year, there was a poem about Dzokhar Tsarnaev, and it was titled My Inability to Pronounce Your Name.\nAs I sit writing these words, the news on the radio is of the start today of the military trial of Private First Class Bradley Manning in Fort Meade, Maryland.\nThe video was shot through the gun-sights of the helicopter, and we watch the death through the fatal crosshairs in the centre.'

S'The company managed to bring its debt down by selling its Australian asset to its own promoter family.Early this year, a subsidiary company, Adani Ports and SEZ, announced the sale of the Abbott Point asset to the Adani family at the book value.\nOn the balance sheet of Adani Port, consolidated debt has come down to Rs 11,000 crore from the earlier Rs 21,000 crore, with the Australian asset sale.\nBankers say the falling rupee against the dollar is a big worry for the group as its forex loans are close to $5 billion and it could jeopardise the entire debt recast plan.'

S'5%, and the economy is currently below that and moving farther away.Now, here\'s one important question: if unemployment is still way too high (as the Fed\'s own analysis suggests) and falling too slowly (ditto), and if inflation is now expected to be below the Fed\'s most recent projections (in which inflation was forecast to be below the 2% target for the foreseeable future, despite the fact that there is a broad consensus that inflation should actually be running above the 2% target now in order to speed up recovery and hasten the departure from very low interest rates), why does the Fed feel the need to provide any guidance about the pace of tapering apart from, "not until we\'re anywhere close to any of our goals"?\nThe answer of course is that the Fed is not strictly operating according to the dual mandate but is worried about other things as well, and those other things are already constraining Fed policy.\nIf the economy has more room for expansion and the Fed scales back its policy anyway, then it is dooming workers to a longer period of labour market slack, a longer period of slow wage growth or joblessness, and some greater level of permanent labour-force scarring.'

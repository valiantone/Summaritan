S"The Spurs, most notably Kawhi Leonard, have been swarming in on LeBron in the paint, effectively daring the ineffective Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh try to beat them.Just as everyone predicted before the series began, San Antonio shooting guard Danny Green is on pace to be the MVP of the NBA Finals.\nThe three-point shooting clinic put on by Danny Green and his teammate Gary Neal in Tuesday night's game was so unexpected that I didn't even consider it as a possibility when trying to think of the least plausible things that could happen in game three.\nObviously the Spurs can't rely on the two of them to keep up their current success rate, regression to the means iis a cruel mistress, but it's helped them survive and take a series lead despite the fact that Tony Parker, Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili have not been having their best series."

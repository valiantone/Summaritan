S'All of this investment was apparently dependent on Cardiff City fans accepting the loss of a significant part of its identity.The bad feeling and downright animosity between sections of the support simmered away in the background as, ironically, the football club enjoyed one of its best ever seasons on the pitch.\nBy February, with Cardiff City runaway leaders at the top of the Championship, Tan deemed that having a team decked out in red was not enough - he wanted to see the fans actively embrace the change.\nThe cynics amongst us would possibly suggest that the whole exercise was deliberately manipulated so that the club, on their high profile return to the top flight, for the first time in 51 years, could point out that the fans chose the kit.'

S'***A look at the prognosis for the Houston Astros and Miami Marlins:Current talentThe simplified version is that the Marlins don\'t score and the Astros don\'t stop the opposition from scoring.Veteran Ricky Nolasco and rookie Jose Fernandez are the bright spots of the rotation but a bullpen with the highest walk rate in the NL just adds to the "find-a-way-to-lose" undercurrent that can devastate a team.\nTheir home ballpark helps the hitters and manager Bo Porter predicted from spring training Chris Carter could run into 30 or so homers (he leads the team with 13) while trying to become consistent enough to be one of the few current hitters who could be part of a long-term solution.\n"The big question is now much star power is there," says Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow, who was stunned by the lack of talent at the upper levels of the minor leagues when he took over at the end of 2011.'

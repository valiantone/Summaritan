S'Papers describing the approaches have just been posted online by the journal Energy and Environmental Science.Both provide a low-energy way to trigger the material that captures the carbon dioxide to release the gas so that it can be stored.\nThe copper ions bind more strongly to the amines than the carbon dioxide does, displacing the carbon dioxide and causing it to bubble off.\nCooling down the mixture of hydrocarbon and solvent a little causes them to separate, allowing the solvent to be used to capture more carbon dioxide.'

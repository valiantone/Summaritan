S"It's the freshest tech news and opinion, served hot.A well-designed cache will not only match the user-perceived performance of a local implementation, but it will actually increase redundancy and therefore the overall availability of the service.\nAny changes, whether they originate from the branch or the datacenter, will be replicated in the background to make sure the content remains synchronized.\nWhether it is a solution like BrancheCache or virtualization redundancy technology, such as Hyper-V Replica, the simple fact that data, applications, and state information are copied to distinct physical locations makes them less susceptible to outages and makes them an additional option for disaster recovery."

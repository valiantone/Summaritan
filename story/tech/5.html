S'MS13-051/KB8239571 - Vulnerability in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (Office 2003 SP3 and Office for Mac 2011).The good news is that this month brings us only five security bulletins - just half the number we had in May - so you might be able to break away and spend some time in the sun sooner than you thought; the bad news is that four of the five require a reboot, and one of them is a critical issue that impacts just about all versions of Internet Explorer (6 through 10).\nThis update is rated important, and addresses a vulnerability in the way Windows handles page fault system calls, that could allow disclosure of information if an attacker logs on to a system and runs specially crafted software (or convinces a legitimate logged-on user to run such software).\nIt addresses one vulnerability in the specifically listed versions of Microsoft Office that is based on the way Office parses specially crafted Office files and could allow remote code execution if a user opens a malicious file or opens/previews a message in Outlook, using Word as the email reader.'

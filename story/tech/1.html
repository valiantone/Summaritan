S"Those crap fests are also generally made of brittle plastic and break easily.There's always a couple straggling ice cubes left that make jerks think there's no reason to refill.\nYou'll be glad you have it next time you reach into the freezer to chill your drink.\nBecause it's hot outside, and people are generally inconsiderate when it comes to little tasks like servicing the ice tray."
